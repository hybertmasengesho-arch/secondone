# Reasoning Hub

One account, three trackers, files, and admin-to-user messaging.

- **`/matrix.html`** — 20-Day Matrix Accuracy Tracker
- **`/reasoning.html`** — The Reasoning Lab (integration + logic, 20 days)
- **`/prep30.html`** — 30-Day EE Year-2 Prep Track
- **`/files.html`** — My Files: upload documents (capped per user, admin-adjustable, default 10), optionally post publicly
- **`/public-files.html`** — everyone's public postings, browsable by any signed-in user
- **`/reader.html`** — read a PDF/Word/text file without uploading it — only a tiny resume bookmark is saved
- **`/admin.html`** — hidden (no nav link for non-admins): promote/demote, pause, delete, set file limits, message, reset passwords, and manage every uploaded file across all accounts

Architecture: **GitHub repo → Netlify (static frontend + one serverless function) → Supabase (Postgres + Storage)**.

## What was broken in the previous version, and what changed

If you're comparing against an earlier copy of this project, here's exactly
what was fixed:

1. **Uploads over ~6MB silently failed on Netlify.** The app allowed 25MB
   uploads, but Netlify Functions (AWS Lambda under the hood) cap a
   synchronous request body around 6MB. Fixed by lowering the limit to 5MB
   (`routes/files.js`, `public/files.html`).
2. **API routes could 404 on Netlify depending on how the path was passed
   through.** `netlify/functions/api.js` now passes `basePath:
   '/.netlify/functions/api'` to `serverless-http`, which strips that
   prefix before Express tries to match `/api/...` routes.
3. **Per-user file limits didn't exist at all**, despite the admin panel
   needing them. Added: a `max_files` column (`supabase/schema.sql`),
   enforcement on upload (`routes/files.js`), an admin endpoint to change
   it (`routes/admin.js`), and a control in `/admin.html`.
4. Removed a stray empty `.gitmodules` file that could cause confusing
   `git submodule` errors on some clients.
5. Pinned `NODE_VERSION = "22"` in `netlify.toml` so Netlify's build uses
   the same Node version this was built and tested against.

## Since then

- Photo uploads (JPG/PNG/WEBP/GIF/HEIC) are now allowed alongside documents
  (`routes/files.js`, `public/files.html`). The size cap is **4MB**, kept
  deliberately under Netlify's ~6MB synchronous request-body cap — Netlify
  also base64-encodes binary bodies before handing them to the function,
  which inflates size by ~33%, so 4MB raw was chosen to stay safely under
  that even after encoding. If you move off Netlify (Render, a VPS, `npm
  start`) this cap can go higher; if you want bigger uploads while staying
  on Netlify, the real fix is a direct browser→Supabase-Storage flow (a
  signed upload URL) that bypasses the function entirely.
- Account Center gained a public contact **email** field and a **WhatsApp**
  confirmation checkbox next to Phone (replacing the old TikTok field);
  `contact_email` and `whatsapp` columns on `users` (`supabase/schema.sql`).
- Users can now message an admin for help from Account Center. Stored in a
  new `help_messages` table, visible to admins as a queue on `/admin.html`
  (mark resolved / reopen, reply — replies reuse the existing admin→user
  `messages` popup).
- A pass of mobile CSS across `theme.css` and every page: full-width
  buttons and forms, 16px inputs (prevents iOS Safari's auto-zoom on
  focus), larger touch targets, and a single-column card grid below
  ~640px.
6. Removed an unused `@supabase/ssr` dependency from `package.json`.

## How it's wired together

Each tracker's own JavaScript calls `window.storage.get / set / delete /
list(key, shared)` — the same interface Anthropic's Claude artifacts use.
`public/js/storage-shim.js` replaces that object with one that calls the
real API (`/api/kv/...`) instead, so the trackers themselves never needed
to change.

The Express app (`app.js`) runs two ways from the same code:
- **Locally / Render / any Node host**: `server.js` wraps it and calls `app.listen()`.
- **Netlify**: `netlify/functions/api.js` wraps the same `app.js` with
  `serverless-http` — no `app.listen()`, Netlify invokes it per-request.
  `netlify.toml` redirects `/api/*` to that function.

## Step 1 — Supabase

1. Create a project at supabase.com.
2. **SQL Editor → New query** → paste the entire contents of
   `supabase/schema.sql` → Run. It's idempotent (safe to re-run).
3. **Storage → New bucket** → name it exactly `documents` → keep it
   **Private** (the API hands out short-lived signed URLs for downloads,
   so it never needs to be public).
4. **Project Settings → API** → copy two values for Step 3:
   - **Project URL** → you'll set this as `SUPABASE_URL`
   - **service_role key** (not `anon`/`public`) → `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`

   The service role key bypasses Row Level Security by design — the
   Express API is the only thing that ever talks to Supabase directly,
   the browser never receives this key. RLS stays enabled on every table
   as a safety net regardless.

## Step 2 — GitHub

```bash
cd reasoning-hub
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Reasoning Hub"
gh repo create reasoning-hub --private --source=. --push
# or: create the repo on github.com, then:
# git remote add origin <url> && git branch -M main && git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3 — Netlify

1. Netlify dashboard → **Add new site → Import an existing project** →
   pick your GitHub repo.
2. Build settings come from `netlify.toml` automatically — publish
   directory `public`, functions directory `netlify/functions`, build
   command `npm install`, Node 20. Confirm and deploy.
3. **Site configuration → Environment variables** → add:

   | Key | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `SUPABASE_URL` | from Step 1.4 |
   | `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | from Step 1.4 — **service_role**, not anon |
   | `JWT_SECRET` | any long random string — generate with `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"` |
   | `ADMIN_EMAILS` | your own email (comma-separated if more than one) |

4. **Deploys tab → Trigger deploy** so the function picks up the new
   environment variables (they don't apply retroactively to the first build).

## Step 4 — Become admin

Open your Netlify URL, register with the exact email you put in
`ADMIN_EMAILS`. You're an admin immediately — `/admin.html` works from
that point on (it's intentionally not linked in the nav for non-admins).

## Verifying it actually works

1. Register a second, non-admin test account.
2. Log in as admin, open `/admin.html`, confirm both accounts appear.
3. As the test account, upload a small file on `/files.html` — confirm it
   appears and can be opened.
4. As admin, send that test account a message — log in as them and reload
   any page, confirm the toast appears.
5. As admin, set that account's file limit to 1, then try uploading a
   second file as them — confirm it's rejected with a clear message.
6. As admin, delete the test account — confirm it disappears from
   `/admin.html` and its uploaded file is gone from Supabase Storage too.

If any of these fail, check the Netlify function logs (Netlify dashboard →
your site → Functions → `api`) — Supabase connection errors and permission
issues show up there with a clear message.

## What the admin panel can do

- **Promote / demote** a user between `user` and `admin`.
- **Pause an account** — they can still log in and see their existing
  data, but can't save new progress or upload/post files until unpaused.
- **Delete an account** — removes the user, every saved progress record
  across all three trackers, and every uploaded file (both the database
  row and the actual file in Supabase Storage).
- **Set a file limit per user** — defaults to 10; new uploads are rejected
  once a user hits their limit. Lowering someone's limit never deletes
  their existing files, it only blocks new uploads.
- **Reset a user's password** directly (there's no email-based reset flow).
- **Send a message** — pops up as a toast the next time that user loads
  any page.
- **Browse and delete any uploaded file**, across every account, from one
  table.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY, JWT_SECRET, ADMIN_EMAILS
npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:4000**.

## Notes on hardening before wider use

This is a solid working base, not a security audit. Before putting it in
front of strangers, consider adding: rate limiting on `/api/auth/login`,
email verification, and a proper self-service password-reset flow
(currently admin-only).
